## 📑 Program Overview

### 📂 Main Folder

| File Name             | Description |
|:---------------------|:-------------------------------|
| [`Array.java`](./Array.java) | Demonstrates basic array declaration, initialization, and traversal using loops. |
| [`Array2.java`](./Array2.java) | Introduces simple operations like inserting and displaying array elements. |
| [`Array3.java`](./Array3.java) | Focuses on performing calculations or transformations on array elements. |
| [`Array4.java`](./Array4.java) | Covers more advanced array manipulations and data processing exercises. |
| [`Array5.java`](./Array5.java) | Explores different ways to work with arrays including sorting and searching operations. |
| [`Solution.java`](./Solution.java) | Contains solutions or utility methods to common array-related problems. |

### 📂 2D Array Subfolder

| File Name               | Description |
